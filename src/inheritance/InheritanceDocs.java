	 * -------- Inheritance ----------
	 * # code re-usability.
	 * # process of accessing properties and methods of parent/base/super class
	 * 	to child/derived/sub class is known as Inheritance.
	 * # also known as IS-A relationship.
	 * # its a Generalization to Specialization process.
	 * # we can inherit only one class at a time.
	 * # Multiple inheritance does not support in java with class but 
	 * 	it happens with interface.
	 * # we can't inherit private properties, methods and constructor.
	 * # 'extends' keyword is used in inheritance.
	 * 
	 * # Syntax :
	 * 
	 * 	 child_class extends parent_class{
	 * 
	 * 		// properties : parent + child
	 * 
	 * 		// methods : parent + child
	 * 	} 
	 * 
	 * e.g
	 * 	class A{
	 * 
	 * 	}
	 * 
	 * 	class B extends A {   // A is parent B is child
	 * 
	 * 	}
	 * 	class C entends B {
	 * 
	 * 	}
